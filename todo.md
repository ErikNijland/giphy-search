- investigate shadow dom / other css scoping features

Maybe:
- css styling: form
- css styling: pagination
- css styling: notification
- button component (with ng-content equivalent)
- input component
- add tslint
- JSX linter for consistent closing html tags
- make link to home conditional (only if there is a clean way to do it)
- add types to api request parameters
- readme
- storybook
- unit tests eco system
- A settings page to switch some stuff like ESRB rating or page size.
- learn context: maybe for different image type based on screen size
- experiment with  media query: different image type for mobile vs desktop
