Maybe:
- form an opinion about: "Multiline JS expressions inside JSX are forbidden"
- css styling: form
- css styling: pagination
- css styling: notification
- button component (with ng-content equivalent)
- input component
- make link to home conditional (only if there is a clean way to do it)
- add types to api request parameters
- readme
- storybook
- unit tests eco system
- A settings page to switch some stuff like ESRB rating or page size.
- learn context: maybe for different image type based on screen size
- experiment with  media query: different image type for mobile vs desktop
