- api error handling
- no results found message
- button component (with ng-content equivalent)
- input component
- add some css styling

Maybe:
- add tslint
- JSX linter for consistent closing html tags
- make link to home conditional (only if there is a clean way to do it)
- message component (for api down message with ng-content equivalent)
- axios instead of fetch
- add types to api request parameters
- cancel pending api request
- investigate shadow dom / other css scoping features
- readme
- storybook
- consider redux
- unit tests eco system
- show info about number of results 
- understand react rendering/updating cycle
- see best practices for making routes type safe
- A settings page to switch some stuff like ESRB rating or page size.
- experiment with  media query: different image type for mobile vs desktop
- enable routing on server (without switching to hashes)
